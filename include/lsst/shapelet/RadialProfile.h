/**
 *  Registry and utility class for multi-Gaussian approximations to radial profiles.
 *
 *  RadialProfile provides C++ access to the saved multi-Gaussian approximations stored in the pickle
 *  files in the data subdirectory of the shapelet package, by maintaining a singleton registry of these
 *  that is populated at import time by tractor.py.  It also provides access to the true (exact) profiles,
 *  (mostly useful for educational/diagnostic purposes) and information about the relationship between
 *  different radii for this profile (see getMomentsRadiusFactor()).
 *
 *  Each RadialProfile object represents a particular "true" profile, and can hold multiple multi-Gaussian
 *  (or multi-Shapelet) approximations with different degrees of fidelity, as controlled by the number of
 *  components in the approximation and the maximum radius at which the approximation was fit.  For more
 *  information about these approximations, see tractor.py and references therein.  All RadialProfiles
 *  are defined in units of the half-light radius of the true profile, even for profiles for which
 *  this is not the radius typically used.
 *
 *  Several predefined subclasses of RadialProfile are defined privately, and can be accessed by name
 *  through the static get() method:
 *   - "gaussian": a single Gaussian profile
 *   - "exp": Exponential profile (Sersic n=1)
 *   - "ser2": Sersic profile with n=2
 *   - "ser3": Sersic profile with n=3
 *   - "dev": de Vaucouleur profile (Sersic n=4)
 *   - "ser5": Sersic profile with n=5
 *   - "lux": SDSS truncated Exponential profile
 *   - "luv": SDSS truncated and softened de Vaucouleur profile
